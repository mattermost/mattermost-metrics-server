This is the metrics server for collecting performance data and trace events of Mattermost application, primarily for mobile app.

This is serverless application built on top of AWS API Gateway and AWS Lambda with data storage that has support to JSON datatypes, either Postgres (default) or MySQL (should work but not tested).

Once deployed to AWS, the API can be accessed using the generated URL and API key.
